### Hi there 👋

<!--
**abhisek/abhisek** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- Building [safedep.io](https://safedep.io)
- I’m working on Platform & Security Engineering
- I’m currently ~learning how to~ secure stuff at scale
- Ask me about infosec, devops, platform engineering, AuthN / AuthZ
- How to reach me: [@abh1sek](https://twitter.com/abh1sek)
- Pronouns: He/Him
- Fun fact: I have closed my coffee shop long back

I am experienced in building

- Multi-product IAM platform for B2B SaaS in fintech space
- Establishing and implementing devsecops culture within platform engineering
- Microservice framework development and maintenance
- Kubernetes native security platform development

My primary techstack currently is [Golang](https://go.dev/). I am also well versed with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and prefer using it for building management applications that are heavy on relational data.

I have been a security researcher in a past life with some CVEs credited to me

* CVE-2015-0085
* CVE-2015-1650
* CVE-2015-1682
* CVE-2015-2376
